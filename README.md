# 🚀 My Full Stack Web Development Courses

## 📋 Project Overview
This project is a full-stack web application that integrates various modern technologies, including **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **React.js**. It follows the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) architecture and includes front-end and back-end development. Bootstrap is used for responsive design, and MongoDB serves as the database.

## 💻 Technologies Used

### Frontend 🌐
- **📄 HTML**: Used for structuring the web pages, forming the foundation of your web content.
- **🎨 CSS**: Applied for styling and making the design responsive. CSS ensures the website is visually appealing across different devices.
- **🖼️ Bootstrap**: A CSS framework used for fast and efficient prototyping of responsive designs.
- **⚡ JavaScript**: Adds interactivity to the website and handles dynamic behaviors, making web pages more engaging.
- **⚛️ React.js**: A JavaScript library used to build reusable components and create single-page applications.

### Backend ⚙️
- **🔧 Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used on the server side for running back-end logic.
- **🚀 Express.js**: A lightweight web application framework used to create APIs and handle HTTP requests/responses.
- **💾 MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for efficiently storing and retrieving data in a flexible, document-based format.
